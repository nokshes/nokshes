# raw ideas:
## target
![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-DISCUSSION-<>.svg)

help cr to reach all of his classmates at 99% affinity. Anywhere,=..messenger,twitter or any other any platform.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CLARIFICATION-ORANGE.svg)

make it more productive and not rely on checking importang stuff manully and make sure things dont get lost like it does in other group chat or group. (List important stuffs other than notices)

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/FUTURE-PLAN-BLUE.svg)

* we can also make an android app on demand
* Nokshes will have a messenger game ***later***

## admin system
![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-DISCUSSION-<>.svg)

* each class and each admin will have code for security reason,*optional.
***but it will be hard for the admin to handle many request. Have to come out some remedy*** 
> subscription code

admin will be able to set importance rating
(What is importance rating? Needs context too.)

admin will can tell which notice is more important by rating it, its not really necessery to be honest
Alternative Solution: Admins cannot set the importance of notice they can only classify notices using tags

## bot capabilities:*

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-IMPLEMENTATION-RED.svg)

bot will be able to separate group a and b.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CLARIFICATION-ORANGE.svg)

bot will be able to forward attatchment from admin.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/akshar-contrib-informational)

attatchments...such as picture link, video, sticker or such.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-IMPLEMENTATION-<>.svg)

bot will relay request to admin if uncapable.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-DISCUSSION-<>.svg)

bot will make sure to make subscriber watch any important notice. Else it will keep re-sending text or attatchment.
(Conflicts with Notification Policy)

## services

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CLARIFICATION-ORANGE.svg)

* Nokshes will send text or attatchments to all subscriber under the admin
* Nokshes will notify about any major events
(How do you describe major events)

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/akshar-contrib-informational)

notifications from admin will best only to the subscribers who subscribed under that certain admin,,,since ther can be several admins
  major events such concerts, sports day, holiday, club day 

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CLARIFICATION-ORANGE.svg)

We should catagorize requests like help, book etc**
(List some more request)
(How would these requests work out??)

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CONTRIBUTION-MAGENTA.svg)

***Reminder***
(List all the categories of notices that should have the ability to be reminded)
(How often will things be reminded?)

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CONTRIBUTION-MAGENTA.svg)
![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/akshar-contrib-informational)

1. Local notification: these notifications will be from cr and they are about his class only.

2. Global notifications: which are about the institute and come directly from institute.

3. Nokshes notification: these are about nokshes, and from nokshes/devs. notificaions about subscription, updates.

4. Service notification: These are will be the alerts.


![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-DISCUSSION-<>.svg)

Nokshes will also provide the copies of emails send by the register office, department, ict center etc.
How the whole notice thing will be implemented??

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-DISCUSSION-<>.svg)

Nokshes ***may*** give anonymous text sevice as user to admin..but wont be anon to devs

Nokshes will keep scret of any vulgar behaviour from users
if any user send inappropriate texts, we will not reveal...or keep privacy. such as if i want sex from nokshes, nokshes will either ignore or reply with a joke... but we wont tell it anyone.. and even if anyone wants to know....even from higher higher authority. It's more like ethics of Nokshes
