# raw ideas:
## target

help cr to reach all of his classmates at 99% affinity. Anywhere,=..messenger,twitter or any other any platform.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CLARIFICATION-ORANGE.svg)

make it more productive and not rely on checking importang stuff manully and make sure things dont get lost like it does in other group chat or group. (List important stuffs other than notices)

instant reply.. So user wont be in dispair and cant blame CR.
(What is instant reply?)

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/akshar-contrib-informational)

instant replies is, bot will reply user immediately...which cr cant handle,,thats why its nokshes is necessery

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/FUTURE-PLAN-BLUE.svg)

* we can also make an android app on demand
* Nokshes will have a messenger game ***later***

## admin system
![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-DISCUSSION-<>.svg)

* each class and each admin will have code for security reason,*optional.
***but it will be hard for the admin to handle many request. Have to come out some remedy*** 
> subscription code

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CLARIFICATION-ORANGE.svg)

admin will be able to set importance rating
(What is importance rating? Needs context too.)


![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/akshar-contrib-informational)

admin will can tell which notice is more important by rating it, its not really necessery to be honest

## bot capabilities:*

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-IMPLEMENTATION-RED.svg)

bot will be able to separate group a and b.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CLARIFICATION-ORANGE.svg)

bot will be able to forward attatchment from admin.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/akshar-contrib-informational)

attatchments...such as picture link, video, sticker or such.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-DISCUSSION-<>.svg)

bot will relay request to admin and devs if uncapable.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-SPECIFICATION-RED.svg)

bot can pull any previous notices.

Nokshes will keep track of notices

(How much older notices will we preserve)

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/akshar-contrib-informational)

one or two weeks tops, but we can deliver any universal notices(explained in catagory of notifications) via iut website

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-IMPLEMENTATION-RED.svg)

* a routine will be saved, and bot will be able to answer any query about routine..including time, where,which room, which teacher.
* bot will remind subscriber...of any extra class, or any assignment submission deadline.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CLARIFICATION-ORANGE.svg)
![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-DISCUSSION-<>.svg)

bot will adapt to new questions.
(Clearify what is new question and how it will be able to answer things like that?)

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/akshar-contrib-informational)

any kind of question... that bot couldn't understand or cant answer, devs should update the the intention library immediately. if a bot cant answer, the question should be forwarded to dev and then dev will take action to update it.
    question such as, Who created you, how are you , what do you eat, it will be as humanly as possible.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-DISCUSSION-<>.svg)

bot will make sure to make subscriber watch any important notice. Else it will keep re-sending text or attatchment.
(Conflicts with Notification Policy)

## services

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CLARIFICATION-ORANGE.svg)

* Nokshes will send text or attatchments to all subscriber under the admin
* Nokshes will notify about any major events
(How do you describe major events)

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/akshar-contrib-informational)

notifications from admin will best only to the subscribers who subscribed under that certain admin,,,since ther can be several admins
    major events such concerts, sports day, holiday, club day 

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-IMPLEMENTATION-RED.svg)

* Nokshes will be a repository for essential files. Such as topshhet for assignment,logo,routines,assignment sheet ?
* Nokshes will have questions of previous exams . We can upload the the questions after every exam and upload pictures from the library

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CLARIFICATION-ORANGE.svg)

We should catagorize requests like help, book etc**
(List some more request)
(How would these requests work out??)

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CONTRIBUTION-MAGENTA.svg)

***Reminder***
(List all the categories of notices that should have the ability to be reminded)
(How often will things be reminded?)

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CONTRIBUTION-MAGENTA.svg)


![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/akshar-contrib-informational)

1. Local notification: these notifications will be from cr and they are about his class only.

2. Global notifications: which are about the institute and come directly from institute.

3. Nokshes notification: these are about nokshes, and from nokshes/devs. notificaions about subscription, updates.

4. Service notification: These are will be the alerts.


![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-DISCUSSION-<>.svg)

Nokshes will also provide the copies of emails send by the register office, department, ict center etc.
How the whole notice thing will be implemented??

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CLARIFICATION-ORANGE.svg)

Nokshes will help to recruit on any operation...such as photographer..graphic designer...dev..
(How do you certify someone as photographer, graphic designer or dev)

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/akshar-contrib-informational)

we can do that by sending a text to everyone "hiring devs, reply for more info" and such. But this kind of request arent made that often, so its not mendatory.

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-DISCUSSION-<>.svg)

Nokshes ***may*** give anonymous text sevice as user to admin..but wont be anon to devs

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PENDING-CLARIFICATION-ORANGE.svg)

Nokshes will keep scret of any vulgar behaviour from users

(What is Vulgar Behaviour??)

(What do we hide??)

![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/akshar-contrib-informational)

this is maybe stupid, but if any user send inappropriate texts, we will not reveal...or keep privacy. such as if i want sex from nokshes, nokshes will either ignore or reply with a joke... but we wont tell it anyone.. and even if anyone wants to know....even from higher higher authority. It's more like ethics of Nokshes
