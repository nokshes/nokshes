raw ideas:
    *admin system
        bot will abide by the admin(cr) by text.
        users will able to subscribe if admin approves.
        there will be multiple admin (atleast two) for each class.
        each class and each admin will have code for security reason,*optional.
        when any subscription request are made, admin will recieve the id, name and the fb id..admin have to varify it himself/herself.
        ***but it will be hard for the admin to handle many request. Have to come out some remedy
        
     *bot capabilities: 
        bot can handle humanly subscription request Exampl: sign me up. I m from SWE 19 batch, IUT, My id 19XXXXXXX.
        bot can pull any previous notices.
        a routine will be saved, and bot will be able to answer any query about routine..including time, where,which room, which teacher.
        ot will remind subscriber...of any extra class, or any assignment submission day.
        bot will adapt to new questions.
